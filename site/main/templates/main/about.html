        	</div>
        	<p>Stegasaurus is a web-based image steganography tool. Here users can encrypt images and text into a larger image file as well as decrypt images which have already had images or text encrypted into them.</p> 
        	<p>Stegasaurus users can upload an image which they wish to have a smaller image or string of text encrypted into. The uploaded images and strings of text are processed into arrays of bytes. The bits comprising the bytes of the smaller image or text are then used to sequentially replace the least significant bits of the larger image's bytes. Because only the least significant bits are modified in the larger picture, the result is that the larger picture looks unchanged when the process is completed.</p>
        	<p>If a Stegasaurus user wishes to decrypt an image previously encrypted with Stegasaurus, they can upload their image at the Decrypt page and choose whether they are decrypting an image or text. The image is processed into an array of bytes. The least significant bits or each byte are sequentially copied into the bytes of another array which is then processed into an image or string of text depending on the user's selection at the Decrypt page.</p>
